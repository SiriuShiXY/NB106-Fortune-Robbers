## Sentiment Classification

We adopt the **FinBERT-BiLSTM-Attention** model architecture for sentiment classification, as proposed in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9581106). All training and inference scripts are located in the folder named *sentiment classification*. **FinBERT** model can be found in this [Github repo](https://github.com/valuesimplex/FinBERT).
